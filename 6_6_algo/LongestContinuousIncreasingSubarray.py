397. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence

Give an integer arrayï¼Œfind the longest increasing continuous subsequence in this array.

An increasing continuous subsequence:

Can be from right to left or from left to right.
Indices of the integers in the subsequence should be continuous.
Have you met this question in a real interview?  
Example
Example 1:

Input: [5, 4, 2, 1, 3]
Output: 4
Explanation:
For [5, 4, 2, 1, 3], the LICS  is [5, 4, 2, 1], return 4.
Example 2:

Input: [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 4
Explanation:
For [5, 1, 2, 3, 4], the LICS  is [1, 2, 3, 4], return 4.
Challenge
O(n) time and O(1) extra space.
