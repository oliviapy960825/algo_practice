You are given three positive integers: n, index, and maxSum. You want to construct an array nums (0-indexed) that satisfies the following conditions:

    nums.length == n
    nums[i] is a positive integer where 0 <= i < n.
    abs(nums[i] - nums[i+1]) <= 1 where 0 <= i < n-1.
    The sum of all the elements of nums does not exceed maxSum.
    nums[index] is maximized.

Return nums[index] of the constructed array.

Note that abs(x) equals x if x >= 0, and -x otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 4, index = 2,  maxSum = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: nums = [1,2,2,1] is one array that satisfies all the conditions.
There are no arrays that satisfy all the conditions and have nums[2] == 3, so 2 is the maximum nums[2].

Example 2:

Input: n = 6, index = 1,  maxSum = 10
Output: 3

 

Constraints:

    1 <= n <= maxSum <= 109
    0 <= index < n
